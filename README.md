# Batting Average Control Project ⚾️

This project explores how much hitters can actually "control" their batting average and BABIP.
We use Statcast/FanGraphs data from `pybaseball`, analyzing plate discipline, batted ball profile, and power metrics.

## Project Goals

- Identify which stats best explain batting average sustainability.
- Develop a new metric to measure a hitter’s ability to control BABIP.
- Compare classical regression models to modern machine learning approaches.

## Tools

- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- pybaseball (for Statcast/FanGraphs data)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Next Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, scatterplots).
2. Regression modeling (AVG & BABIP vs K%, BB%, HR/FB%, etc.).
3. Test machine learning models for predictive accuracy.
4. Validate across multiple seasons.
